## Summary

We know that 72,458 roles will need to be filled likely within a few years span as employees retire at age 65. As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact we can expect to see approximately 16,981 employees looking to retire in the first year. This conclusion was made based on refactoring the code for identifying currently-employed, retirement-eligible employees with birth dates between 1952 and 1955. A new table was created to include a birth_date column so that we could further breakdown the when a number of employees are  likely to retire. The below example is for the span of a year, but it could also evaluate smaller timeframes such as a three month period for training or human resources purposes.

There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. Code was written to show the count of employees per department that are eligible for the program. This can be used to ensure that there are enough employees to become  mentors by comparing it to the number of those eligible for mentorship. With the highest amount of mentorship-eligible employees being in the Staff and Senior Engineer roles, we also see that the highest amount of retirement-ready employees come from the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff roles. In every role, there are considerably higher numbers of retirement-ready employees in comparison to the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program.
